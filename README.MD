The start of the blog. At the moment this is just a project plan. This document will be fleshed out with the my initial thoughts and will slowly evolve as this project evolves.

## Doman
I've bought barryosull.com, and I will be hosting it there.

## Features
Ability to post, edit and remove an article
Article are written in a markdown editor that uses Jekyll front matter.
Can share links to unpublished articles
Can tag articles
Can categorise articles (maybe same as tagging?)

## Next steps
Think about it some more, flesh out the todos, maybe look into potential solutions.
